                Files and Directories, Naming Covertion, and Fie Allocation(FAT)
            </h2>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <h5>Directory Structure</h5>
            <p>
                Windows organizes files using a drive-letter system. The most common example is c: for the main system
                drive.The file path uses backslashes (\) as separators, as seen in a typical path like
                c:\users\mlab\Documents.
            </p>
            <h5>Naming Convertion</h5>
            <p>
                File names are not case sensitive. This means that file names like documents.txt and Documents.txt are
                considered the same, therefore they cannot exist in the same folder. The only allowed characters when
                naming a file are the null character and the forward slash (/)
            </p>
            <h5>File Systems</h5>
            <p>
                The file system that is primarily used in Windows is NTFS or, to a lesser degree, the Resilient File
                System (Reefs), which Microsoft introduced in 2012 promising to support greater availability, resiliency
                and scalability. Although the FAT system has been superseded on most Windows computers, current Windows
                editions still
                support FAT
            </p>

            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <h5>Directory Structure</h5>
            <p>
                Linux OS is based on UNIX and shares a similar hierarchical file system structure with MacOS. Everything
                starts from a single root directory, denoted by a forward slash (/). All files, directories, and even
                connected devices descend from this root. File paths use forward
                slashes (/) as separators, for example: /home/user/documents
            </p>
            <h5>Naming Convertion</h5>
            <p>
                The file system is case-sensitive. Document.txt and document.txt are considered the same. The only
                allowed characters when naming a file are the null character and the forward slash (/)
            </p>
            <h5>File Systems</h5>
            <p>
                The most common file system is ext4 (Fourth Extended File System). Linux still support FAT
            </p>

            <h3>MacOS</h3>
            <h5>Directory Structure</h5>
            <p>
                MacOS is based on UNIX and shares a similar hierarchical file system structure with Linux. Everything
                starts from a single root directory, denoted by a forward slash (/). All files, directories, and even
                connected devices descend from this root. File paths use forward
                slashes (/) as separators, for example: /home/user/documents
            </p>
            <h5>Naming Convertion</h5>
            <p>
                By default, the file system (APFS) is case-insensitive but case-preserving, similar to Windows. This
                means it recognizes the difference in capitalization but treats files with the same name and different
                cases as identical. However, it is possible to format a drive to be case-sensitive.
            </p>
            <h5>File Systems</h5>
            <p>
                The current standard is the Apple File System (APFS).MacOS still support FAT just like the other two
                operating systems.

                Executable File Extensions
            </h1>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <h5>Executable File Types</h5>
            <p>
                The most common executable file has the .exe extension. Windows also uses .dll (Dynamic Link Library)
                files, which are loaded at runtime. The underlying format for these is called Portable Executable (PE).
            </p>
            <h5>Script Execution</h5>
            <p>
                Scripting can be done through Batch files (.bat), Command files (.cmd), or PowerShell scripts (.ps1).
                The Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is a traditional command-line interpreter, while PowerShell is a more
                advanced shell and scripting language built on the .NET framework, offering more power and flexibility
                for system administration.
            </p>

            <h3>MacoS & Linux</h3>
            <h5>Executable File Types</h5>
            <p>
                These UNIX-based systems do not rely on file extensions to identify executables. Instead, they use a
                file permission flag that marks a file as executable. While an executable file might not have an
                extension, common formats include ELF (Executable and
                Linkable Format) for Linux and Mach-O for macOS. Callable shared objects on these systems often use the
                .so extension.
            </p>
            <h5>Script Execution</h5>
            <p>
                Both systems use shell scripts to automate tasks. These are text files containing UNIX commands. On
                macOS, the Terminal app provides access to the shell, which is commonly Zsh or Bash. On Linux, the Bash
                (Bourne-Again Shell) is a widely used default. To be executed, a script file typically needs to be
                marked as executable using the chmod command.Shell scripts are often identified with a .sh extension and
                begin with a "shebang" (#!) that specifies the interpreter to be used, such as #!/bin/bash.
