                <h1>AFRICAN IT PROFESSIONALS</h1>
                <h4>This blog focuses on the struggles or rather the challenges that Africans whom take IT as a
                    profession face.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    IT professionals covers a wide range of job description:
                    from HTML/CSS coder to Front-End development and responsibilities.
                    It is what they do and know, but even as professionals
                    they do face challenges from time to time. The challenges include:

                    <h4>Skill gap</h4>
                    <p>
                        <i>Skill gap</i> is the difference in skill of IT professionals and that of
                        people seeking jobs in the IT profession. It is very costly to close the gap but
                        this is a crucial step that IT companies should invest in.
                        skills gaps will only grow and further debilitate IT departments unless actions are taken.
                        Strategic and continual training is the antidote. That’s the good news.
                        The uphill battle is conveying the value to management and securing budget to ensure employees
                        receive continual training.
                        IT professionals need better support. If organizations do not invest in their employees’ skills
                        now, they will pay for it down the road.

                    <h4>Cloud computing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cloud computing refers to saving and accessing of data on the internet instead of
                        saving it on your hardware. It saves a lot memory and a lot more safer than
                        your computer where it can be misplaced or erased by mistake. Cloud professionals
                        are high in demand and short supply. Despite the worker shortage, organizations are all-in on
                        cloud solutions.

                        Cyberattackers are growing rapidly in size whilst cybersecurity jobs remain
                        unfilled. This is due to lack of relevant skills from job seekers. THere are not enough
                        IT professionals with cybersecurity expertise. There is not an immediate solution to this
                        problem,
                        but a long-term fix is to build your cyber workforce from the inside.
                        Invest in cybersecurity training and upskill your current staff.
                        Hiring and outsourcing is not always a viable (or cheap) solution.
                        Current IT professionals who know the industry are more apt to transition
                        into successful cybersecurity professionals.

                        <i>Digital transformation</i> is latest disrupter. It has led to technology no longer providing
                        a
                        sustained competitive advantage. It now plays a supporting role to people with the right skills.
                        Expertise is needed now more than ever to manage and implement all of the new technologies.
